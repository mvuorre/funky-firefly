# Practical introduction to latent mean centering in multilevel models of longitudinal data

>Work in progress! :smile:

This repository contains materials, code, and data for reproducing our manuscript discussing practical implementations of latent mean centering in multilevel models of longitudinal psychological data.

This project is currently developed here: <https://mvuorre.github.io/posts/stan-latent-mean-centering/> and discussed on the Stan board: <https://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/latent-mean-centering-latent-covariate-models-in-brms/29424>. Huge thanks already to everyone who contributed to the discussion!

# Contributing

I'm trying to track this project on [GitHub issues](https://github.com/mvuorre/latent-mean-centering-ms/issues). Feel free to peruse there for tasks that I think need to be done at the moment, or propose new ones. Contributions, if possible, via pull requests (if not, independent `.R` scripts or text files work just fine!)

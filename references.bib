  abstract = {Appropriately centering Level 1 predictors is vital to the interpretation of intercept and slope parameters in multilevel models (MLMs). The issue of centering has been discussed in the literature, but it is still widely misunderstood. The purpose of this article is to provide a detailed overview of grand mean centering and group mean centering in the context of 2-level MLMs. The authors begin with a basic overview of centering and explore the differences between grand and group mean centering in the context of some prototypical research questions. Empirical analyses of artificial data sets are used to illustrate key points throughout. The article provides a number of practical recommendations designed to facilitate centering decisions in MLM applications. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {A complete, practical guide to planning and executing an intensive longitudinal study, this book provides the tools for understanding within-subject social, psychological, and physiological processes in everyday contexts. Intensive longitudinal studies involve many repeated measurements taken on individuals, dyads, or groups, and include diary and experience sampling studies. A range of engaging, worked-through research examples with datasets are featured. Coverage includes how to: select the best intensive longitudinal design for a particular research question, model within-subject change processes for continuous and categorical outcomes, distinguish within-subject from between-subjects effects, assess the reliability of within-subject changes, assure sufficient statistical power, and more. Several end-of-chapter write-ups illustrate effective ways to present study findings for publication. Datasets and output for the examples are available for readers' use at the companion website. The website also includes HLM, MLwin, and R code as an alternative to the SPSS, SAS, and Mplus code presented in the book.},

  abstract = {Alternative ways of analyzing data from Aptitude Treatment Interactions were examined over a two-year period. In light of past arguments the author maintains that the questions surrounding aggregation have been badly posed and that the customary methods of analysis were either incorrect or subject to misinterpretation. Therefore, the majority of studies of educational effects--whether classroom experiments, or evaluations of programs or surveys--have collected and analyzed data in ways that conceal more than they reveal. The established methods have generated false conclusions in many studies. Further, the traditional research strategy which pits substantive hypotheses against a null hypothesis and requires statistical significance of effects can rarely be used in educational  research. Samples large enough to detect strong, but probabilistic effects are likely to be prohibitively costly. (Author/MV)},

  abstract = {This is a first-class book dealing with one of the most important areas of current research in applied statistics the methods described are widely applicable the standard of exposition is extremely high." --Short Book Reviews from the International Statistical Institute "The new chapters (10-14) improve an already excellent resource for research and instruction. Their content expands the coverage of the book to include models for discrete level-1 outcomes, non-nested level-2 units, incomplete data, and measurement error--all vital topics in contemporary social statistics. In the tradition of the first edition, they are clearly written and make good use of interesting substantive examples to illustrate the methods. Advanced graduate students and social researchers will find the expanded edition immediately useful and pertinent to their research." --TED GERBER, Sociology, University of Arizona "Chapter 11 was also exciting reading and shows the versatility of the mixed model with the EM algorithm. There was a new revelation on practically every page. I found the exposition to be extremely clear. It was like being led from one treasure room to another, and all of the gems are inherently useful. These are problems that researchers face everyday, and this chapter gives us an excellent alternative to how we have traditionally handled these problems." --PAUL SWANK, Houston School of Nursing, University of Texas, Houston Popular in the First Edition for its rich, illustrative examples and lucid explanations of the theory and use of hierarchical linear models (HLM), the book has been reorganized into four parts with four completely new chapters. The first two parts, Part I on "The Logic of Hierarchical Linear Modeling" and Part II on "Basic Applications" closely parallel the first nine chapters of the previous edition with significant expansions and technical clarifications, such as: * An intuitive introductory summary of the basic procedures for estimation and inference used with HLM models that only requires a minimal level of mathematical sophistication in Chapter 3 * New section on multivariate growth models in Chapter 6 * A discussion of research synthesis or meta-analysis applications in Chapter 7 * Data analytic advice on centering of level-1 predictors and new material on plausible value intervals and robust standard estimators While the first edition confined its attention to continuously distributed outcomes at level 1, this second edition now includes coverage of an array of outcomes types in Part III: * New Chapter 10 considers applications of hierarchical models in the case of binary outcomes, counted data, ordered categories, and multinomial outcomes using detailed examples to illustrate each case * New Chapter 11 on latent variable models, including estimating regressions from missing data, estimating regressions when predictors are measured with error, and embedding item response models within the framework of the HLM model * New introduction to the logic of Bayesian inference with applications to hierarchical data (Chapter 13) The authors conclude in Part IV with the statistical theory and computations used throughout the book, including univariate models with normal level-1 errors, multivariate linear models, and hierarchical generalized linear models.},

  abstract = {Technological advances have led to an increase in intensive longitudinal data and the statistical literature on modeling such data is rapidly expanding, as are software capabilities. Common methods in this area are related to time-series analysis, a framework that historically has received little exposure in psychology. There is a scarcity of psychology-based resources introducing the basic ideas of time-series analysis, especially for data sets featuring multiple people. We begin with basics of N ϭ 1 time-series analysis and build up to complex dynamic structural equation models available in the newest release of Mplus Version 8. The goal is to provide readers with a basic conceptual understanding of common models, template code, and result interpretation. We provide short descriptions of some advanced issues, but our main priority is to supply readers with a solid knowledge base so that the more advanced literature on the topic is more readily digestible to a larger group of researchers.},
